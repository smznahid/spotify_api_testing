# Testing spotify API using spotipy in python


## Usage: 

After cloning the repo, make sure you create a  ```credentials.json``` in the following format:

```
{
    "client_id" : # your spotify dev app client_id here,
    "client_secret" : # your spotify dev app client_secret here,
    "redirect_URI" : # your spotify dev app redirect_URI
}
```
install spotipy using either:
- ```pip install spotipy ```
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

after creating your json file and install spotipy you can run one of the scripts and test and tweak to your liking.
